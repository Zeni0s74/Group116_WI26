    "Music has been a cultural product and public pastime since as long as most of humanity can remember. And as such, music has been a driving force during times of struggle in many economic and social senses experiences among people across the world.  As stated by Shanmugaboopathi, \"'music can influence the mind and emotions of people'. Almost all the people, about 92.16% of the respondents, have positively reacted and 5.88% of the participants have denied the statement.\"(Shanmugaboopathi, D., and J. Catoto, 2022).<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) Shanmugaboopathi shows that music is heavily prevalent in how humans experience and interact with life on the psychological/emotional level. With additional notable examples of this being times of recession like the 1920s and even more recent such as the 2010s.  \n",
    "\n",
    "During this era, music served as a key play into cultural life, desire for joy, and for pleasure. Especially energy and time dedicated to escapism and the experience. A topic in of itself can be observed from a technological streaming standpoint. Regardless, this has been researched. As de Lucio and their colleagues note, “Consumers postpone the purchase of durables, use more repair services, provide some services on their own and are most likely prone to pursuing pleasure consumption.” Which has been aptly described as the Lipstick Effect.”(de Lucio, J., Palomeque, M). The effect itself being something particularly unique to economic strife and can be seen in other economic sectors besides music but I digress. \n",
    "\n",
    "With music’s impact and the overall importance of economic growth and study. The two have been combined together into analysis. Marco Palomeque has taken care to be analytical in their approach. Recording such as music consumption and consumer constraint. Hoping to analyze and refine. Aiming to measure the positiveness of music coming out during the COVID-19 era. Including additional factors such as the economy and social factors,<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) and how those 3 as a whole play into the overall social impacts of the lipstick effect. Even beyond that, Paleomeque’s research made sure to keep a thorough measure of unemployment tand its implication on the human psyche, iterating as “Unemployment has a negative impact on both well-being and mental health. During recessions, the latter is affected not only by unemployment, but by job insecurity, increased workload and changes in job scope”(palomeque.)\n",
    "\n",

    "Another Group adjusted, to focus on the billboards, magazines, and survey data related to songs during the recession. Using data banks such as North American Industry Classification System, databases from Dun and Bradstreet and more.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) Taking a look into deeper implications of music's success in the 2000s. Choosing to focus on some of the five most popular music cities and how the trend in music and economic downturn play together. Things such as employee counts and number of businesses in music related sectors were also analyzed. Especially when the music would touch upon rumination, something that differs from the general trend of desiring upbeat music during times of concern. The emphasis on \"pessimistic rumination\" makes for an interesting perspective. \n",

When the circumstances for an unfavorable economy are present, it would more than likelty influence the people to seek out forms of media to provide a semblence of escape, thus even if things like GDP may show a continued upward growth, the popularity of escapist music may suggest that GDP alone may not serve as a definite measure of the economic climate."

    " - [ ] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "> As our research question involves a lot of data collection regarding popular pop songs, as a group we will be mindful of any potential biases that could be introducted during data collection, such as selection bias or sampling bias.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "> While we do not intend on the exposure of any personally identifiable information, we will take this into consideration, avoiding the collection of any additional personal or private information that is not relevant to our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Potential downstream bias will be considered, and we acknowledge that we must pay close attention to biased outcomes as we collect data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> While we intend on using publicly available lyrics, we will ensure that we handle the data in a responsible manner.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We do not expect long-term storage of our data to be necessary, and so intend on retaining the data only for the duration of our project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [ ] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The datasets we intend on using will go through an appropriate process of data wrangling and cleaning to ensure that no possible source of bias goes unchecked.\n",

    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We are aware that our choice of defining metrics can influence our conclusions, and we will consider additional metrics if we feel the need to do so.\n",

    " - [ ] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n"
