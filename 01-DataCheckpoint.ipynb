    "Music has been a cultural product and public pastime since as long as most of humanity can remember. And as such, music has been a driving force during times of struggle in many economic and social senses experiences among people across the world. As stated by Shanmugaboopathi, \"'music can influence the mind and emotions of people'. Almost all the people, about 92.16% of the respondents, have positively reacted and 5.88% of the participants have denied the statement.\"(Shanmugaboopathi, D., and J. Catoto, 2022).3 Shanmugaboopathi shows that music is heavily prevalent in how humans experience and interact with life on the psychological/emotional level. With additional notable examples of this being times of recession like the 1920s and even more recent such as the 2010s.\n",
    "\n",
    "During this era, music served as a key play into cultural life, desire for joy, and for pleasure. Especially energy and time dedicated to escapism and the experience. A topic in of itself can be observed from a technological streaming standpoint. Regardless, this has been researched. As de Lucio and their colleagues note, “Consumers postpone the purchase of durables, use more repair services, provide some services on their own and are most likely prone to pursuing pleasure consumption.” Which has been aptly described as the Lipstick Effect.”(de Lucio, J., Palomeque, M). The effect itself being something particularly unique to economic strife and can be seen in other economic sectors besides music but I digress.\n",
    "\n",
    "With music’s impact and the overall importance of economic growth and study. The two have been combined together into analysis. Marco Palomeque has taken care to be analytical in their approach. Recording such as music consumption and consumer constraint. Hoping to analyze and refine. Aiming to measure the positiveness of music coming out during the COVID-19 era. Including additional factors such as the economy and social factors,1 and how those 3 as a whole play into the overall social impacts of the lipstick effect. Even beyond that, Paleomeque’s research made sure to keep a thorough measure of unemployment tand its implication on the human psyche, iterating as “Unemployment has a negative impact on both well-being and mental health. During recessions, the latter is affected not only by unemployment, but by job insecurity, increased workload and changes in job scope”(palomeque.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Another Group adjusted, to focus on the billboards, magazines, and survey data related to songs during the recession. Using data banks such as North American Industry Classification System, databases from Dun and Bradstreet and more.4 Taking a look into deeper implications of music's success in the 2000s. Choosing to focus on some of the five most popular music cities and how the trend in music and economic downturn play together. Things such as employee counts and number of businesses in music related sectors were also analyzed. Especially when the music would touch upon rumination, something that differs from the general trend of desiring upbeat music during times of concern. The emphasis on \"pessimistic rumination\" makes for an interesting perspective.\n",

Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",

    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?"
