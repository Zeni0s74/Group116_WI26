    "Music has been a cultural product and public pastime since as long as most of humanity can remember. And as such, music has been a driving force during times of struggle in many economic and social experiences among people across the world. As stated by Shanmugaboopathi, \"'music can influence the mind and emotions of people'. Almost all the people, about 92.16% of the respondents, have positively reacted and 5.88% of the participants have denied the statement.\"(Shanmugaboopathi, D., and J. Catoto, 2022).<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) Shanmugaboopathi shows that music is heavily prevalent in how humans experience and interact with life on the psychological/emotional level. With additional notable examples of this being times of recession like the 1920s and even more recent such as the 2010s.\n",
    "\n",
    "During this era, music served as a key play into cultural life, desire for joy, and for pleasure. Especially energy and time dedicated to escapism and the experience. A topic in of itself can be observed from a technological streaming standpoint. Regardless, this has been researched. As de Lucio and their colleagues note, “Consumers postpone the purchase of durables, use more repair services, provide some services on their own and are most likely prone to pursuing pleasure consumption.” Which has been aptly described as the Lipstick Effect.”(de Lucio, J., Palomeque, M). The effect itself being something particularly unique to economic strife and can be seen in other economic sectors besides music but I digress. The point of this research is to break down, side by side, recessive trends. High prices, low income, and how music takes a shift in its content and overall mood and style. The core of this  \n",
    "\n",
    "With music’s impact and the overall importance of economic growth and study. The two have been combined together into analysis. Marco Palomeque has taken care to be analytical in their approach. Recording such as music consumption and consumer constraint. Hoping to analyze and refine. Aiming to measure the positiveness of music coming out during the COVID-19 era. Including additional factors such as the economy and social factors,<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) and how those 3 as a whole play into the overall social impacts of the lipstick effect. Even beyond that, Paleomeque’s research made sure to keep a thorough measure of unemployment tand its implication on the human psyche, iterating as “Unemployment has a negative impact on both well-being and mental health. During recessions, the latter is affected not only by unemployment, but by job insecurity, increased workload and changes in job scope”(palomeque.)\n",
    "\n",
    "From this research from Mr Palomeque there are certain metrics provided through the system, Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning AKA VADER. A tool that has been used to analyze the billboards top 100 as well as other \"sentiment\" related survey style questions. As it relates to the paper at hand, song age and overall listener audience mood. Which when linked to time, can help our group do analysis of music trends along side GDP, and spotify listening data. Metrics that will help us better correlate types of songs with certain time periods in the US.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another Group adjusted, to focus on the billboards, magazines, and survey data related to songs during the recession. Using data banks such as North American Industry Classification System, databases from Dun and Bradstreet and more.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) Taking a look into deeper implications of music's success in the 2000s. Choosing to focus on some of the five most popular music cities and how the trend in music and economic downturn play together. Things such as employee counts and number of businesses in music related sectors were also analyzed. Especially when the music would touch upon rumination, something that differs from the general trend of desiring upbeat music during times of concern. The emphasis on \"pessimistic rumination\" makes for an interesting perspective. This series of studies helps our group with a few case studies in Georgia and Atlanta. Notably metric data tied to business SIC numbers are utilized and can be seen in serveral of the graphs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Among these Marco palomeque and his colleagues have another study that is focused very similarily on our topic. Their data process drawed from many before them, and addressed billboards and listening trends. Most notably in those very periods of economic recession and COVID 19 as a recent example. Their techniques of interest are the Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the nature of lyric style and mood.<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5) They make a series of observations about how music has gradually become more easily accessible and how they suspected that as the positivity of lyrics and melodies grew, a soothing effect would develop along side with it. In which they tied the dot together with Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED). A statistical source that we want to use in our own analysis. There are additional COVID-19 related indexes like the Stringency Index made by Hale et al as stated in the paper.  \n",

    "We predict that there exisists some correlation between thre two while it may not be a strong connection, it most liekly does exist. When the circumstances for an unfavorable economy are present, it would more than likelty influence the people to seek out forms of media to provide a semblence of escape, thus even if things like GDP may show a continued upward growth, the popularity of escapist music may suggest that GDP alone may not serve as a definite measure of the economic climate."

Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",

    "### Top 10000 Songs on Spotify 1950-Now\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset includes a list of around 10000 songs that are popular on Spotify that released in the past 75 years. Additionally, it includes Spotify metadata such as popularity, danceability, energy, valence, loudness, speechiness, acousticness, and instrumentalness. All but the loudness and popularity are float values that range from 0 to 1, with 1 meaning that the song has a higher factor of the given variable. These values will help to determine if a song is more upbeat and joyful or slower and sadder. Additionally, Spotify gives each song a popularity score that helps their algorithm determine whether or not to recommend a song to the listener. This value ranges from 0, not a very popular song, to 100, a very popular song. This value will help us to determine the genres of music that have higher popularity by comparing them to the artist_genre values. Additionally, there is a tempo variable that is in beats per minute, which will help us to verify that some songs are edm, or similar genres of music. The main downside of this data set is that most of the data comes from values that Spotify gave each song, and the determination of each value is kept hidden by Spotify."

The main variables that appear to contain a lot of outliers are speechiness and instrumentalness. For speechiness, the outliers likely represent spoken word music such as rap and hip-hop while the outliers for instrumentalness will likely represent genres of music with close to no words, like edm. Acousticness also appears to have a good number of outliers, but that would most likely account for classical music or similar genres."

    "This dataset is composed of all the songs that were put on the Billboard Hot 100 from 2000 to 2023. The main component that makes this dataset helpful compared to the top songs on Spotify dataset is that this one has columns for the rank received on the Billboard, with the year it was given the rank, and the music lyrics. The rank is a value from 1 to 100, where 1 means that the song was the most popular of that year and 100 was the least popular. This will help determine the songs that were more popular during economic crises. Additionally, we can use sentiment analysis on the lyrics to determine if the most popular songs during a year with an economic crisis had higher escapism values. This dataset also includes Spotify data, but after examining the null values, it appears that most of the values are null. This can be fixed later by using the Spotify metrics from the songs in dataset one."

We can leave the values null for right now, and in the future, if deemed necessary, we can merge this with the Spotify dataset to get the Spotify data for each of the songs on the Billboard. The only downside is that we may still not have a single dataset with all of the important variables if there is not enough overlap between the songs listed in each dataset."

Most of the outliers can be written off as songs that simply have a lot of lyrics, like rap, or longer songs. However, there are some songs that have over 10000 words, which is most likely a data error, so we will remove them in the cleaning process."

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [ ] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "> As our research question involves a lot of data collection regarding popular pop songs, as a group we will be mindful of any potential biases that could be introducted during data collection, such as selection bias or sampling bias.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "> While we do not intend on the exposure of any personally identifiable information, we will take this into consideration, avoiding the collection of any additional personal or private information that is not relevant to our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Potential downstream bias will be considered, and we acknowledge that we must pay close attention to biased outcomes as we collect data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> While we intend on using publicly available lyrics, we will ensure that we handle the data in a responsible manner.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We do not expect long-term storage of our data to be necessary, and so intend on retaining the data only for the duration of our project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [ ] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The datasets we intend on using will go through an appropriate process of data wrangling and cleaning to ensure that no possible source of bias goes unchecked.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We are committed to presenting representations in a manner which accurately reflects the underlying data.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We intend on using non-PII data which is publicly accessible. No personally identifiable information will be used beyond what is necessary for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We will document our steps clearly so that our methods and decisions are reproducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We acknowledge the risk of proxy discrimination and we will examine our variables to ensure that such proxy discrimination is not introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We are aware that our choice of defining metrics can influence our conclusions, and we will consider additional metrics if we feel the need to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?"
